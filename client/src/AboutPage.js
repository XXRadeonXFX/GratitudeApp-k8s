        This Gratitude &amp; Mood journal runs as a microservice playground: a
        React frontend, multiple Node.js services leveraging gRPC, and a shared
        Postgres database running inside Kubernetes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Log gratitude entries, track your mood, and watch weekly insights update
        in real time as the services talk to each other. Itâ€™s a compact but
        practical demo of cloud-native patterns you can actually use every day.
